# LeetCode-2025

**Description:**  
The **LeetCode-2025** project is a year-long coding challenge where I solve one LeetCode problem every day using the **Kotlin programming language**. This repository serves as a personal log of consistent practice, showcasing my solutions, optimized approaches, and growth in problem-solving skills.  

## Project Highlights  
- **Daily Problem-Solving:** Solutions for LeetCode's daily challenges throughout 2025.  
- **Language:** Written in Kotlin for concise and modern coding practices.  
- **Code Structure:** Organized with clear folder hierarchies, problem descriptions, and cleanly documented solutions.  
- **Version Control:** Daily updates pushed to GitHub for tracking progress and maintaining a structured workflow.  
- **Purpose:** Enhancing my problem-solving abilities, practicing algorithm design, and preparing for coding interviews.  

## Repository Structure  
- `/src`: Contains daily solution files grouped by month.  
  - Example: `/src/January/1_MaximumScoreAfterSplittingString.kt.`.  
- `/resources`: Contains problem statements and notes (if needed).  

## Why Kotlin?  
Kotlin's expressive syntax and powerful features make it an ideal choice for writing clean, efficient, and maintainable solutions.
